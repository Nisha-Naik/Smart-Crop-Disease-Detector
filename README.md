# 🌾 Smart Crop Sentinel – AI-Powered Crop Disease Assistant

> **Smart Crop Sentinel** is a hackathon-built, end-to-end AI web application that allows farmers to **upload a crop leaf image**, automatically **detects the disease**, and provides **complete treatment plans, medicines, application instructions, and “search to buy” links** in both **English and Kannada**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Farmers frequently observe unusual spots, discoloration, or decay on crop leaves but struggle to understand:

- What disease the crop is suffering from  
- How severe or fast-spreading it is  
- Which chemical/organic solution to use  
- How to apply the treatment safely  
- Where to purchase the correct fungicide or pesticide  

**Smart Crop Sentinel** solves this gap with a powerful combination of **computer vision (CNN)**, **LLM-driven disease intelligence**, **multilingual translation**, and a **farmer-first UI**.

### ✔ End-to-End Workflow

1. Farmer uploads a **single leaf image** or clicks a live photo.  
2. AI identifies the **crop type** + **disease** with accuracy.  
3. The disease engine generates:
   - Disease name & scientific name  
   - Severity & spread rate  
   - Detailed cause  
   - Step-by-step actionable treatment  
   - Recommended fungicides/pesticides with dosage + safety  
4. “**Search to Buy**” button opens Google with the exact product query (BigHaat, Amazon, Flipkart etc.)  
5. Farmers can **translate** the entire solution into Kannada instantly.  
6. Results are saved automatically in **Analysis History** for future reference.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 AI Image-Based Disease Detection
Upload a leaf → AI predicts:
- Crop name  
- Disease name (e.g., *Marssonina Blotch*, *Anthracnose*, *Goss’s Wilt*)  
- Detection accuracy %  
- Disease stage (Mild / Moderate / Severe)  
- Spread rate (Slow / Medium / Rapid)

---

### 📊 Rich Disease Summary Card


---

### 💊 Recommended Medicines (Fully Explained)
Each recommendation contains:

## 🧠 How It Works (End-to-End Flow)

1. **Upload Image**  
   The user uploads/drag-drops the crop leaf image.

2. **AI Vision Model Classifies Disease**  
   A CNN or vision model identifies crop + disease label.

3. **LLM Knowledge Engine Generates Explanation**  
   It creates:  
   - Disease cause  
   - Treatment strategy  
   - Recommended medicines  
   - Actionable steps  

4. **Translation Service**  
   Converts content to Kannada or any supported language.

5. **Search-to-Buy Link Builder**  
   Forms queries like:  
   `buy Mancozeb M-45 fungicide`

6. **Client-side History Storage**  
   Saves analysis items for easy access.
